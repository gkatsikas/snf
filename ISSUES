 * Check function class that returns Object to see whether we can use references
 * Change enums to static class members
 * Replace direct access to FieldOperation members by getters & setters
!* What happens in case of consecutive ranged write + write conditions?
		--> a write condition has to mention which element wrote it
!* Write range -> replace by DisjointSegmentList?
		--> RoundRobinIPMapper takes discrete inputs
!* Add "Unsupported Elements" category ==> allow to use unsupported elements anyway
		--> can still look at (if it applies) the modified/read fields

BUG:
	* FromDevice leads to incorrect classifier

TODO:
	* if Click prefix != /usr/local/bin SNF compilation fails because it cannot detect the custom Click path
	* The upper bound of a filter must not be MAX uint32_t but adjusted to the header field's upper bound (e.g., port <= 65535).
	* add ID to all elements
	* add pointer->element in Write operations
	* Identify comments in active lines of the SNF language
	* Make IPSynthesizer IPRwriter's child and extend properly
	* Direct both directions of a proxy/NAT to the same IPClassifier
	* IPSynthesizer should batch packets even if they are fragmented by the internal IPFragmenter
	* 3rd pattern of Synthesizer does not have keyword
	* Empty classifiers are generated in case of stateful chains with more than 2 interfaces
	* Use m4/snf.m4 to apply system checks (e.g., CXX compiler, CLICK, DPDK) and alleviate configure.ac

FIXED:
	* ip_filter_parser had duplicate pf_vec_to_str. Now it has one
	* ip_filter_parser BUG: In filter_from_src/dst_option; goto was used only in case Option::SRC/DST_UDP_PORT (not for TCP). Now it is used on both.
	* ip_filter_parser BUG: In filter_from_icmp_option, header field was IP src instead of icmp_type
	* output_class.cpp BUG: In output_class_from_pattern, the destination IP part was using header field IP SRC. Now it uses IP dst.
