 * Export a runnable, SNF configuration that implements a
 * service chain in a distributed, hardware-assisted fashion.
 * The conditional part of the chain (i.e., read and classify flows)
 * is exported to a programmable NIC. The NIC encodes the traffic
 * classes using FlowDirector filters and sends the matching packets to
 * different CPU cores.
 * Each core is then assigned with a pipeline that modifies the
 * corresponding traffic class accordingly.
 * This processing model is totally distributed because each core's pipeline is
 * different; we do not replicate the pipeline of the entire chain).
