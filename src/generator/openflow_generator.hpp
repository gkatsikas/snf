/*
 * openflow_generator.hpp
 *
 * Class for exporting a hardware-assisted SNF configuration.
 * SNF's global service chain classifier (i.e., ``read-part of the synthesis) is
 * translated into a set of OpenFlow v1.3 rules that can be deployed to either
 * a hardware or software-based OpenFlow v1.3 switch.
 * The switch will apply tags (e.g., VLAN) to the derived traffic classes
 * and send those classes to one or multiple NFV servers.
 *
 * On the server side, a Click-DPDK module is generated with the following properties:
 * |-> Generate a set of Flow Director rules that will guide each VLAN tag
 *     (coming form the switch), to a different hardware queue of the NIC.
 * |-> Read packets from different hardware queues of the NIC, using one
 *     FromDPDKDevice element per queue.
 * |-> Scheduling of all the FromDPDKDevice elements to perform distributed I/O
 *     across multiple cores.
 * |-> Implementation of the ``write'' part of the synthesized chain in Click.
 *     Packets read by a FromDPDKDevice on a particular queue will be modified by
 *     the synthesized Click modification element and then sent out of the chain.
