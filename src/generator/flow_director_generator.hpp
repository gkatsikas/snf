 * Class for exporting a hardware-assisted SNF configuration.
 * SNF's global service chain classifier (i.e., ``read-part of the synthesis)
 * is translated into a set of NIC-specific rules using the FlowDirector API.
 * Each rule associates the matching packets with a particular CPU core
 * that will undertake their processing.
 * After a packet is caught by a core, a set of Click elements undertake
 * its modifications.
